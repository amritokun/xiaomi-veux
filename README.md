- Unstable / Bugs :
- [ ] There's no vibration lomiri keyboard taps (it works everywhere else),
- [ ] The keyboard clicks still produce sounds even when the phone is on Silent mode (disabled by default),
- [ ] Hotspot (aka sharing mobile data with other devices) occasionally causes kernel panics. But it's rare.

Untested :
- [ ] NFC (seems to work)
- [ ] VoLTE (should work)

Unsupported (won't/can't fix) :
- [ ] UDFPS (Underdispay fingerprint is apparently not supported by UT yet)
- [ ] Glyphs interface aka the LED strips on the back of the phone (not sure how to fix these). They can still be controlled through sysfs
- [ ] 90Hz and 120Hz display refresh rates
